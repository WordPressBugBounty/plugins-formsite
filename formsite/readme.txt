= What is the advantage of using this plugin by a Formsite customer? =
Use the provided `[formsite]` shortcode in pages, posts, and sidebars instead of adding the Embed Code to the HTML.

= Can I use the regular Embed Code instead of installing this plugin to use the shortcode? =
Yes, you can still use the Embed Code from the form's Share -> Embed Code page by pasting in HTML blocks or widgets, or the Text Editor for users who don't use blocks.

= Will this plugin show my forms inside WordPress account so I can select the form I want to embed? =
